# Generative AI Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Generative AI Learning Repository**!  
This space serves as a personal notebook where Iâ€™ll be uploading my progress, experiments, and insights as I explore the fascinating world of **Generative AI**.

## What to Expect

This repository will include:
- Notes and summaries of core concepts  
- Hands-on notebooks and mini-projects  
- Explorations with popular libraries (like Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, etc.)  
- Experiments with open-source models and inference pipelines  
- My learnings around prompt engineering, LLMs, multimodal models, fine-tuning, and more  

## Goal

To continuously grow my understanding and practical skills in **Generative AI**, while sharing useful resources and implementation examples with the community.
